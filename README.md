# Project Boost ðŸš€  
*A finished 3D rocket navigation game built in Unity.*  

## Description  
Project Boost is a physics-based rocket game where the player must carefully pilot a small rocket from a launch pad to a landing pad while avoiding obstacles. The rocket can rotate using the arrow keys or WASD, and boost upward with the spacebar. Colliding with obstacles will cause the rocket to explode with sound and visual effects, resetting the level. Reaching the landing pad moves the player on to the next stage.
